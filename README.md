# Neat
Custom implementation of the neuro-evolutionary processes described in the paper "Evolving Neural Networks through Augmenting Topologies".<br>

Progress:
- [x] Implement feed forward neural network with a customizable structure.
- [x] Allow the network to be represented and reconstructed by a set of genes.
- [x] Develop the possibility for random mutations in a network's structure.
- [x] Implement the ability to perform a crossover between two genomes.
- [x] Write the code for speciation and to calculate their adjusted fitnesses and size at each generation
- [x] Load the configurations needed from a file, whilst still allowing their customization.
- [x] Make a system that keeps track of every connection gene's innovation number when dealing with mutations.
- [x] Finish the process involved in creating a new generation from the current one.
- [ ] Add statistics reporters and nice printing for the process
